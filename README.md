# VolleyballScoreKeeper
I'm a huge fan of the sport - I play it, and I do some officiating myself. But there are times where there isn't a score keeper present, or if they are they aren't paying much attention. So I developed the Volleyball Score Keeper app to allow me to keep track of scores myself. The Volleyball Score Keeper app was built only for iOS devices using Swift.
<br />
<br />
**What can this application do?**<br />
Once installed, you are able to keep track of your matches (of course, it can be used universally for any sport that has singular numerical point system).
- The app allows you to have custom team names
- The app asks you for maximum sets per match, and points per set
- You can swap sides if required
- You can reset match scores

**Still to do**
- [ ] Save/Reload matches
- [ ] Add a "Professional Match" option for Technical Timeouts at Designated 8 and 16 points.
- [ ] Support different screen sizes (As of now, it only supports the iPhone 5, 5S and SE).
- [ ] Improve the "about match" form (for scores and sets).

Note: I will probably never upload this to the app store as I can't afford the Developer fees. You can pull this project and install on your device, or if you would like a direct .ipa file - send me a message!
